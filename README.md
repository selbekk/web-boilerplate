# The simplest repo you'll find

I find myself creating boilerplate code simply to test some javascript or css stuff way too often.

This repo simply contains all you need to get up and running, so that you don't have to repeat yourself :-)

To get started, simply clone a copy, create a branch for whatever you want to do, and throw it away when you're done.

**RESULT!**
